# File:        remail.sh
#
# Description: A simple Cypherpunk message preprocessor that makes it
#              simpler to chain Type I anonymous remailers together.
#
# Examples:    Use remail.sh to prepare a multihop anonymous email in
#              a Cypherpunk remailer system. Usage is simple:
#
#                  ./remail.sh message.txt recipient@example.com \
#                      mixmaster@remailer1.com \
#                      mixmaster@remailer2.com
#
#              You can chain an arbitrary number of remailers; you're
#              not limited to just two.
